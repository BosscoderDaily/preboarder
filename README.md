# Preboarder
*This app is on the merchant's side and hence will have the prerequisite of the merchant having the python height measure app which we have built and added to this repo in the python folder
as a direct .py file. The python file produces a .csv which must be uploaded to the merchant's database, from which height information can be accessed by this web app.*

## Airline Preboarding App ##
This app uses OpenCv and TensorFLowIo with webcam recognition to 'scan' a passenger pre-boarding the flight and give them an ergonomic and optimized seat position reccomendation throught an algorthim
which estimates the best seat on the basis of age, family, disabilities if any and height.

This is a very basic implementation of the idea and can be tested by downloading the index.html along with the sample.csv file and uploading the sample.csv for the app to get a sample height information.
